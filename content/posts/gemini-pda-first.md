## Gemini PDA First Impressions
 
I received my Gemini PDA/Phone a couple days ago. Basically, this is an android smartphone in a clamshell design with a physical keyboard. The makers also fully support rooting, custom roms, and dual booting into linux.

Goals for this device:

1. I was partially hoping to use it as my primary phone. However, the screen is not visible when closed, and the device lacks a decent camera. Becoming the primary phone would require some sacrifice.
 
2. Use it for amateur radio. Under android I can run APRSDroid, and under linux I can run fldigi and CHIRP for programming.

3. Possibly do some programming in GO, while on the go. With Termux android app, I can install Git, ssh keys, vim, and golang. I've compiled go code on another android phone and ran the resulting binary, so this should be totally possible. 

4. Write blog posts on the move.


## Initial Impressions

Let me get all the initial annoyances and unresolved problems out of the way first:
 
1. During setup, the keyboard layout was not Enlish(US). The 2 key has the @ sign, but shif+2 provided a double quote ("). Having encountered this with raspberry pis, I knew what the issue was, but had to do some work to get around the setup screen and find a place to set the gemini keyboard to English(US).
 
2. Invoking a soft keyboard like lastpass or gboard causes the physical keyboard to revert to the UK layout.
 
3. The colon and semicolon are not to the right of the L. You have to press Fn + \ for colon and Fn + K for semi-colon. Several other keys are in odd spots, and the priority is almost certaintly based on a UK layout. For instance, the period is where I expect the comma to be and the up arrow is where I expect the period to be. Often while ending a sentence, I end up one line above (or the beginning of a line). A UK person may love this layout, and I know every small keyboard has to deviate, but these deviations are really messing me up.  Ie, the keyboard is just familiar enough to get some speed, but that comfort makes it easierto make mistakes. I am hoping that in the future, we can get blank keycaps and software to remap all they keys.

4. I took a verizon sim out of my work iphone and it doesn't entirely work. This might be either Apple or Verizon's fault though. I can receive but not make calls, and send but not receive sms  messages. The same sim in my ZTE axon works fine.  VoLTE 4G data wors fine though.
