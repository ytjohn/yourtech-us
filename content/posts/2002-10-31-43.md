I did however, go running again last night.  It was an easy run, somwhere around 2.25 miles through town.  I didn't have a watch to time myself with, so I don't know how fast I ran it in, but it probably isn't an impressive time anyway.  After running, I feel more on top of my game, which should be motivation enough for me to run in and of itself.
